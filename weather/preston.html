          <h2>Treasure Map Found At Dig Site</h2>
          <img alt="Preston Rodeo" src="images/butch.jpg"/>

          <p>Preston, Idaho is known for two things; Napoleon Dynamite, and potatoes. However, after the discovery
            of a treasure map was found by a construction worker preparing the ground for the new Preston
            Aquatic Center three weeks ago on a Tuesday afternoon, perhaps Preston will be known for three
            things. Jim Brigham was doing some digging when he noticed an old bottle that looked like it had
            something inside. Upon closer inspection, he realized he had found a map. Lucky for him his wife, Barbra
            Brigham, has an interest in cartography and was able to identify that the map was of the surrounding
            area and seemed to lead to a treasure. She says,</p>

          <blockquote><i>“Just below the map is an inscription that, after carefully examining, seems to say B.
            Cassidy Insurance Policy. We believe that this could be a map that leads to some
            treasure that Cassidy may have stashed away for a rainy day.”</i></blockquote>
          
          <p>After Mrs. Brigham realized what her husband had found she took the bottle and map to Utah State to
            be examined by some visiting professors. Together they were able to deduce that the map and bottle
            were indeed real. The finding of the map has created a buzz throughout the town that has everyone
            excited. Mr. Brigham says,</p>

          <blockquote><i>“My kids and their friends have been talking about finding the treasure since I
            brought it home. It’s caused everyone to get excited about the mystery of the map
            and if the treasure is still hidden.”</i></blockquote>

          <p>In four weeks the Map is to be put on display for the town to come and see for themselves. Who knows,
            perhaps some will even seek the adventure that comes with finding buried treasure.</p>
