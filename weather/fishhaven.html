          <h2>Lost Girl Found With Treasure</h2>
          <img alt="Preston Rodeo" src="images/treasure.jpg"/>
          <p>Yesterday afternoon was a rainy day filled with dark skies and lightning. Yet, that did not stop the town
            of Fish Haven from celebrating a miracle that has brought smiles and excitement to not just our town
            but to the loved ones of Sally Field. Four days, before the smiles of the Fish Haven citizens brought
            sunshine to the otherwise rainy day, a vigil was held for Ms. Fields who had been missing after she and
            her friends were out hiking and treasure hunting for the Butch Cassidy’s treasure on the border of Fish
            Haven and Soda Springs. While exploring, the teens decided to leave the trails for the sake of adventure
            and came across a bear that caused Sally to be separated from her group. In her words, Sally describes
            how she was separated;</p>

            <blockquote><i>“I remember running when we saw the bear, I thought my friends were behind me
            but when I turned around and before I could see if they had followed me I fell down a
            hill and became knocked out. When I got up I was at the entrance of a cave.
            Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to search the cave, it’s what I had been
            out there to do anyway.”</i></blockquote>

            <p>This terrifying experience was soon eclipsed by the excitement of finding the lost treasure of
            Butch Cassidy. However, a bear was not the only thing Sally had to face. There was the matter of other
            treasure hunters. Soon after finding the treasure, Sally was kidnapped by some less-than-friendly
            treasure hunters who wanted the treasure for themselves. Using her wits and the surprising help from a
            squirrel Sally was able to free herself and was rescued by one of the volunteers for her search party.
            Currently, Sally has been reunited with her friends and family and has been given official credit for
            finding the treasure. As for the less-than-friendly treasure hunters, they’ll be spending time behind bars
            and as far away from the treasure as possible.</p>
